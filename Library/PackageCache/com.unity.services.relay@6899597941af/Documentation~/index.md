# Unity Relay
> Important: The Relay package is deprecated in Unity 6 and will not receive further updates. The Relay SDK is now part of the unified Multiplayer Services package (com.unity.services.multiplayer). [Migrate](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual/migration-path) to that package to access ongoing support and improvements.

Please consult the documentation here: https://docs.unity.com/relay/

You can also go to the [Relay Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/relay) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.
